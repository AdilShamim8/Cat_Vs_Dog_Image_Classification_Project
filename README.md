# Cat vs Dog Image Classification Project

## Description

The Cat vs Dog Image Classification Project is a machine learning initiative aimed at building an automated system capable of accurately classifying images as either featuring a cat or a dog. Leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, this project utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to distinguish between these two popular pet species based on visual input.

### Features

- **Dataset**: The project is built on a curated dataset comprising thousands of labeled images of cats and dogs, allowing the model to learn from diverse examples.

### Steps to Add Photos from an Online Server:
1. **Find Image Hosting**: You can use image hosting platforms like Imgur, Dropbox, Google Drive (make sure to get the shareable link), or any reliable image hosting service.
  
2. **Upload Images**: Upload the images you want to use to the selected platform.
  
3. **Get Direct Links**: Ensure you get direct links to the images (these usually end in .jpg, .png, etc.).

4. **Replace Placeholder URLs**: Replace the placeholder URLs (e.g., `https://example.com/path-to-your-image.jpg`) in the Markdown with the actual URLs of your uploaded images.

Make sure the images you select are free to use or appropriately credited. If you have any questions or need further help with your project, feel free to ask!
