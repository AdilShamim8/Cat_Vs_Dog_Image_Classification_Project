###  Usage

1. **Prepare Your Dataset**
   Organize images into `data/train/cats`, `data/train/dogs`, `data/validation/cats`, and `data/validation/dogs`.
2. **Train the Model**

   ```bash
   python train.py --epochs 20 --batch_size 32
   ```
3. **Evaluate Performance**

   ```bash
   python evaluate.py --model_path models/cat_dog_classifier.h5
   ```
4. **Predict New Images**

   ```bash
   python predict.py --image_path path/to/image.jpg
   ```
