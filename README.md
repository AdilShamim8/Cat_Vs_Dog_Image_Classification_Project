# Cat vs Dog Image Classification Project

## Description

The Cat vs Dog Image Classification Project is a machine learning initiative aimed at building an automated system capable of accurately classifying images as either featuring a cat or a dog. Leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, this project utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to distinguish between these two popular pet species based on visual input.

### Features

- **Dataset**: The project is built on a curated dataset comprising thousands of labeled images of cats and dogs, allowing the model to learn from diverse examples.
- **Model Architecture**: A custom CNN model is designed and trained to extract relevant features from images, enhancing classification accuracy.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Various preprocessing techniques are applied, including normalization, augmentation, and resizing, to improve model robustness.
- **Training and Validation**: The model is trained using a split of training and validation datasets to ensure generalization and prevent overfitting.
- **Performance Metrics**: The project evaluates model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Visualization**: Includes tools for visualizing training progress, metrics, and confusion matrices for comprehensive analysis.

### Objectives

- To develop a reliable image classification model that can differentiate between cat and dog images with high accuracy.
- To explore various deep learning techniques and hyperparameter optimization to enhance model performance.
- To provide a well-documented codebase for educational purposes and future enhancements.
