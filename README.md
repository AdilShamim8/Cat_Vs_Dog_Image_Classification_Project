Cat vs Dog Image Classification Project

Description :

The Cat vs Dog Image Classification Project is a machine learning initiative aimed at building an automated system capable of accurately classifying images as either featuring a cat or a dog. Leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, this project utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to distinguish between these two popular pet species based on visual input.
